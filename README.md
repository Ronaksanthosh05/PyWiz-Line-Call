# This python code uses the OpenCV library to call balls as in or out of the tennis line boundaries. It reads a video file of a ball in motion, uses binary search to find the frame where the ball is touching the ground, prints "in" or out" with an audible "out" call if applicable, and displays the result in a saved  image titled "result.jpg"
